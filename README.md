## Security & Production Deployment

‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT**: This application handles sensitive financial data and OAuth tokens. Please review the security documentation before deployment.

### Quick Security Setup
1. **Review security documentation**: See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for detailed security guide
2. **Run security check**: `./scripts/security-check.sh`
3. **Hash admin password**: `./scripts/hash-password.sh username password`
4. **Production deployment**: `docker-compose up -d app postgres-db`
5. **Development with debug**: `docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d`

### Security Features Implemented
- üîê BCrypt password hashing for admin credentials
- üõ°Ô∏è Rate limiting on authentication endpoints (5 attempts/minute)
- üîí PostgreSQL pgcrypto encryption for OAuth tokens
- üåê Configurable OAuth redirect URIs for server deployment
- üì° Security headers (HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options, etc.)
- üö´ Input validation and sanitization
- üèóÔ∏è Production Docker configuration without debug ports

### Critical Environment Variables
```bash
OAUTH_REDIRECT_URI=https://your-domain.com/oauth2callback
ALLOWED_HOST=your-domain.com
DATABASE_PASSWORD=your_strong_password
```

If the server starts successfully, you'll see the following output:
